# head_tracking_robotic_arm

personal project to combine facial recognition and robotics:

(work in progress, much more to come)

1. webcam mounted on a homemade 3 dof robotic arm
2. scans the room for face detection
3. once detected, autonomously manuvers the robotic arm such that face remains at center of frame
4. follows the movement of the face

project timeline:

1. face recognition (done, see eigenface)
2. robotic arm, mechanical design (done)
3. robotic arm, control:
	inverse kinematics, path planning, gcode generator, 	microcontroller interface (done, see videos)
4. face extraction (to do)
5. integration (to do)
